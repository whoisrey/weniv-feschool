        <h1>Eagles</h1>
        <p>Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several
          groups of genera, some of which are closely related. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and
          Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be foundâ€”2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America,
          and 3 in Australia.

          Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable
          (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates.</p>
