        <p><strong>New York</strong>, often called New York City[a] or NYC, is the most populous city in the United
            States. With a 2020
            population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is the most densely
            populated major city in the United States and more than twice as populous as Los Angeles, the nation's
            second-largest city. New York City is located at the southern tip of New York State. It constitutes the
            geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area,
            the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With over 20.1 million people
            in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York
            is one of the world's most populous megacities, and over 58 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of
            the city. New York City is a global cultural, financial, entertainment, and media center with a significant
            influence on commerce, health care and life sciences,research, technology, education, politics, tourism,
            dining, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important
            center for international diplomacy,and is sometimes described as the capital of the world.</p>
        <p><strong>Etymology</strong> In 1664, New York was named in honor of the Duke of York, who would become King
            James II of England. James's elder brother, King Charles II, appointed the Duke as proprietor of the former
            territory of New Netherland, including the city of New Amsterdam, when England seized it from Dutch control.

        <p><strong>Geography</strong> During the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City
            area
            was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet over 2,000 feet (610 m) in depth. The erosive forward movement
            of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten
            Island. That action also left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most
            of Manhattan's skyscrapers.

            New York City is situated in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately
            halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into
            a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a
            trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten
            Island.

            The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New
            York, the river is an estuary. The Hudson River separates the city from the U.S. state of New Jersey. The
            East River—a tidal strait—flows from Long Island Sound and separates the Bronx and Manhattan from Long
            Island. The Harlem River, another tidal strait between the East and Hudson rivers, separates most of
            Manhattan from the Bronx. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only
            entirely freshwater river in the city.

            The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation
            along the waterfronts since Dutch colonial times; reclamation is most prominent in Lower Manhattan, with
            developments such as Battery Park City in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the natural relief in topography has
            been evened out, especially in Manhattan.

            The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2); 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of the city is land
            and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of this is water. The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten
            Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south
            of Maine.The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.</p>
